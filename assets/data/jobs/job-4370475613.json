Gourmet Cuisine. World-class shopping. Entertainment galore. What exactly are we talking about here? Arizona, of course!</p>\r\n    <p>The “Copper State” has been nicknamed as such because a large stretch of the Grand Canyon runs through this Southwestern state. Travel nurses in Arizona love this state for a wide variety of reasons.</p>\r\n    <p>What are those reasons? First, the breathtaking sceneries! Arizona is home to many different sites that you can explore during your days off, such as the red rocks of Sedona, the sandstone spires of Monument Valley, and of course, most-famously - the Grand Canyon. If you are looking for travel nursing jobs in Arizona because you can’t get enough of the sun, you will love the capital city Phoenix, along with Scottsdale, Tucson, and Flagstaff. In all these major cities in Arizona, you are going to find an endless selection of world-class shopping, art galleries, museums, entertainment, and nightlife.</p>\r\n    <p>Another nickname given to the state of Arizona is the “Desert State” for obvious reasons, of course. Travel nurses working in Arizona enjoy venturing out to the Sonoran Desert that booms with exotic plants and incredible wildlife. Not everything is dry in this state. If you’re into water sports, you must hit up the Colorado River in Arizona for whitewater rafting! Are you a golf enthusiast? Not only is Arizona home to some popular and amazing golf courses, but it also provides the perfect weather in the winter months for comfortable golfing.</p>\r\n    <p>Ambitious entrepreneurs, artists, and writers are drawn to the state of Arizona. If you go there on a travel nursing assignment, no doubt you are going to meet influential, colorful people who will enrich your life. Because of its sheer popularity, there is fierce job competition, therefore, Arizona travel nurse pay is on the higher end of the scale.

If so, check out Mesa, Arizona where 10 Major League Baseball teams compete in the Cactus League and complete their spring training.
